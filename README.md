#Morphomatics: Geometric morphometrics in non-Euclidean shape spaces

Morphomatics is an open-source Python library for (statistical) shape analysis developed within the [geometric data analysis and processing](https://www.zib.de/visual/geometric-data-analysis-and-processing) research group at Zuse Institute Berlin.
It contains prototype implementations of intrinsic manifold-based methods that are highly consistent and avoid the influence of unwanted effects such as bias due to arbitrary choices of coordinates.
